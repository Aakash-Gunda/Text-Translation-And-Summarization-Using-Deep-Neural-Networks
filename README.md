# Text-Translation-And-Summarization-Using-Deep-Neural-Networks

According to a report from the international data corporation, the total amount of digital data will exceed 180 Zettabytes by 2025 compared to 4.4 Zettabytes in 2013.  Most of the data circulating in digital space is nonstructural text data of different languages. So it is important to deliver accurate summaries that can fluently pass the intended messages. Text translation opens up many new domestic and international market opportunities especially in the field of academics where a lot of academic research papers are in native languages. Text summarization has applications in many domains. Reading summaries instead of reading big paragraphs can enhance the efficiency of information acquisition and can save a lot of time. Summaries can also be used to classify and index documents, text summarization can assist in other NLP tasks such as question answering and sentiment analysis. Manual text summarization is a time expensive and generally a laborious task. So, there is a need to develop automatic text translation and summarization tools that allow people to gain insights from the text easily. Text Summarization has two methods Extractive summarizarion and Abstractive summarization regarding which we have discussed further in the report, we are using a hybrid approach consisting of both these methods.
